# Tiny compiler imp.
__Thanks for [this tutorial](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) for help__.
The goal of this project is to compile this tiny language into cpp or python code. The syntax of this language is given toro language syntax section.
The input is the `input.toro` file and the corresponding cpp code is output in the ` output.cpp` file and python code is in the ` output.py` file. 

## Project structure
__Please look at the ` UML.pdf` to get the structure of the project.__
This project is consisted of three main classes.
* Lexer class : `./lexer/Lexer.cpp` is responsible for lexing the code and output tokens.
* Parser class : `./parser/Parser.cpp` is responsible for parsing the tokens generated by the lexer and use the emitter class to emit the compiled code.
* emitter class : `./emitter/Emitter.cpp` is responsible for generating the compiled code in cpp language.

For each class there is a tester script that test the functionality of it.

* Lexer tester : `./lexer/main.cpp` to test the lexer
* Parser tester : `./parser/main.cpp` to test the parser

There is no tester for the emitter because it is quite intuitive.

## Build and run
The project runs on c++20.
Just use cmake to build it and run.
This will take toro code in the `input.toro` file and output cpp code in the `output.cpp` file and the python code in the `output.py`.

### Unit testing:
the parser and the lexer has unit tests. You can build and run them using cmake too. Just go to the class directory and check the `CMakeLists.txt` .

## Toro lang syntax

Our language syntax support :
* Number variables : `let var_name = 3.14`
* Printing test : `output "Hello world"`
* Printing numbers : `output var_name*4`
* Input numbers : `input var_name`
* If statement :
```
let var_name = 3.14
if var_name <= 3.14 then
output "Pi"
endif
```

* While loop :
```
let var_name = 10
while var_name > 0 repeat
output var_name
var_name = var_name - 1
endwhile
```
* Comments start with #: `#this is comment`

* __Toro lang does not support extra lines at the end of the code or extra spaces at the end of each line__. please look at the sample at `./input.toro`
